# Concepts of Statistics for Data Analytics

# Statistics

Collecting, Analysing, Interpreting, and concluding is called **STATISTICS**

E.g. 4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentine
     Average score of students in Math
     The minimum number of participants required is six

Statistics -> Descriptive Statistics -> Collection, Analysis, and Interpretation of Data -> Understanding Main 						Features of Data (Organising and Summarizing E.g. Graphs, Tables, average.
           -> Inferential Statistics -> Drawing Conclusions from the Data, E.g. Population (taking a sample)

E.g. Estimating Average Height of a Population with a 95% confidence interval

Types of Variables

Nominal -> Gender, Colours
Ordinal -> Education levels, Customer Ratings
Numerical -> Numerical Values E.g. Income, Age, Price
Categorical -> Types of CARS, Product Categories ]-> Ordinal or Nominal
Interval -> E.g. Temperature, IQ Score  ]-> Numerical Value
Ratio -> Height, Weight, Age            ]-> Numerical Value

A sample is taken out of the population:

Why Sample?

Subset of the Populations

-> To reduce the cost of data collection
-> Sample is the subset of the population

Sampling Technique

Random
Stratified
Systematic
Clustered

How to choose sampling Techniques

Nature of Population
Research Objective
Available Resources


Statistics Data Analysis

Define the problem or research question
Data Collection
Data Cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Transformation
Hypothesis Formulation
Statistical Testing
Interpretation of Results
Draw Conclusions
Documents the Analysis Process / Report Making

Mean is best calculated in the case of No OUTLIERS
Median is best calculated in case of OUTLIERS
Mode is best calculated in the case of Categorical Variables


Measures of Dispersion:

-> Degree of Variation
-> Range or IQR ( Q3 - Q1 -> 50% of middle data)
-> Quartiles, Percentiles
-> Variance and STD


NOTE: Range is sensitive to Extreme Values
      Range does not consider the distribution of the data
      Range is suitable for Small Datasets.

IQR -> Not sensitive to Extreme Values


Graphical Representations

Histogram
Box Plots
Scatter Plots

Histograms

-> It displays the distribution of data. It can also be used for identifying Patterns, Outliers, and skewness

E.g. Frequency Vs Values category can be plotted.

Based on skewness -> Symmetric, Right Skewed, Left Skewed
