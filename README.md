# Concepts of Statistics for Data Analytics

# Statistics

Collecting, Analysing, Interpreting, and concluding is called **STATISTICS**

E.g. 4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentine
     Average score of students in Math
     The minimum number of participants required is six

**Statistics ->**

1. -> Descriptive Statistics -> Collection, Analysis, and Interpretation of Data 
1.1 -> Understanding Main Features of Data (Organising and Summarizing E.g. Graphs, Tables, average.
2. -> Inferential Statistics -> Drawing Conclusions from the Data, E.g. Population (taking a sample)

E.g. Estimating Average Height of a Population with a 95% confidence interval

**Types of Variables**

1. Nominal -> Gender, Colours
2. Ordinal -> Education levels, Customer Ratings
3. Numerical -> Numerical Values E.g. Income, Age, Price
4. Categorical -> Types of CARS, Product Categories ]-> Ordinal or Nominal
5. Interval -> E.g. Temperature, IQ Score  ]-> Numerical Value
6. Ratio -> Height, Weight, Age            ]-> Numerical Value

A sample is taken out of the population:

Why Sample?

Subset of the Populations

1. To reduce the cost of data collection
2. Sample is the subset of the population

Sampling Technique

1. Random
2. Stratified
3. Systematic
4. Clustered

How to choose sampling Techniques

1. Nature of Population
2. Research Objective
3. Available Resources


Statistics Data Analysis

1. Define the problem or research question
2. Data Collection
3. Data Cleaning
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Data Transformation
6. Hypothesis Formulation
7. Statistical Testing
8. Interpretation of Results
9. Draw Conclusions
10. Documents the Analysis Process / Report Making

**Mean** is best calculated in the case of No OUTLIERS.
**Median** is best calculated in case of OUTLIERS.
**Mode** is best calculated in the case of Categorical Variables.


**Measures of Dispersion:**

1. Degree of Variation
2. Range or IQR ( Q3 - Q1 -> 50% of middle data)
3. Quartiles, Percentiles
4. Variance and STD


NOTE: 1-> Range is sensitive to Extreme Values
      2-> Range does not consider the distribution of the data
      3-> Range is suitable for Small Datasets.
IQR -> Not sensitive to Extreme Values


**Graphical Representations**

1. Histogram
2. Box Plots
3. Scatter Plots

**1. Histograms**

-> It displays the distribution of data. It can also be used for identifying Patterns, Outliers, and skewness

E.g. Frequency Vs Values category can be plotted.

Based on skewness -> Symmetric, Right Skewed, Left Skewed
